# GAN
Python implementation of GAN

A basic GAN (generative adversarial network) is implemented for learning and testing. Currently it is based on the MNIST dataset and creates synthetic handwritten digits. 
In a later step this will be expanded to create synthetic 3d models.

It is based on [this website](https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f).
